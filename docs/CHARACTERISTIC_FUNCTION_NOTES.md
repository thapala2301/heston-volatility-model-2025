## 1. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

### 1.1 Black–Scholes Limitation
The **Black–Scholes model** assumes constant volatility:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t\,dt + \sigma S_t\,dW_t
$$

**Problem:** Real markets exhibit:
- Volatility that changes over time  
- Correlation between price and volatility  
- “Volatility smiles” in option data  

### 1.2 Heston’s Breakthrough Solution
Heston introduced **stochastic volatility**, allowing volatility to evolve randomly:

$$
\begin{cases}
dS_t = \mu S_t\,dt + \sqrt{v_t}\,S_t\,dW_t^1, \\\\
dv_t = \kappa(\theta - v_t)\,dt + \sigma\sqrt{v_t}\,dW_t^2, \\\\
dW_t^1 dW_t^2 = \rho\,dt.
\end{cases}
$$

Where:
- **√vₜ** — stochastic volatility  
- **κ** — mean reversion speed  
- **θ** — long-term average variance  
- **σ** — volatility of volatility  
- **ρ** — correlation between price and volatility shocks  

### 1.3 The Mathematical Challenge
- **Black–Scholes:** simple closed-form solution exists.  
- **Heston:** no direct formula for option prices — must derive one using **characteristic functions** and **Fourier transforms**.

## 2. WHAT IS A CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION?

### 2.1 Probability Foundation
For a random variable \( X \), its **characteristic function** is:

$$
\phi(u) = \mathbb{E}[e^{i u X}]
$$

Where:  
- \( i = \sqrt{-1} \): imaginary unit  
- \( u \): real (or complex) frequency variable  
- \( \mathbb{E} \): expected value  

### 2.2 Simple Example — Coin Flip
If \( X = 1 \) (heads) or \( 0 \) (tails) with probability 0.5 each:

$$
\phi(u) = 0.5\,e^{i u} + 0.5\,e^{0} = 0.5(e^{i u} + 1)
$$

### 2.3 The Fourier Inversion Magic
A probability density \( f(x) \) can be recovered from its characteristic function:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi(u)e^{-iux}\,du
$$

So \( \phi(u) \) encodes the **entire distribution** of \( X \).

### 2.4 For Stock Prices
For option pricing, we want the characteristic function of the **log-price** \( \ln S_T \):

$$
\phi(u) = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{i u \ln S_T}\right]
$$

This compactly stores all information about the future distribution of \( S_T \).

## 3. WHY FOURIER? WHY COMPLEX NUMBERS?

### 3.1 The Mathematical Superpower
- Directly integrating over random paths is hard.  
- Characteristic functions often have **analytic solutions**, even when densities don’t.

### 3.2 Complex Numbers as Rotation Operators

$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)
$$

In the complex plane, \( e^{i\theta} \) means a **rotation** by angle \( \theta \).

### 3.3 Fourier Transform as a “Mathematical Prism”
Just as a prism splits light into colors, the Fourier transform decomposes a distribution into frequency components that are easier to analyze.

### 3.4 Carr–Madan Insight (1999)
Carr and Madan showed that **option prices** can be expressed directly as the **Fourier transform of the characteristic function** — a massive simplification for stochastic models like Heston.

---

## 4. THE HESTON CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION

### 4.1 The Mathematical Result
Heston (1993) derived that the characteristic function has **exponential–affine form**:

$$
\phi(u) = \exp\!\left(C(\tau,u) + D(\tau,u)v_t + i u \ln S_t\right),
$$

where \( \tau = T - t \) is time to maturity.

---

### 4.2 The \( C(\tau,u) \) and \( D(\tau,u) \) Functions
Define intermediate variables:

$$
\begin{aligned}
b &= \kappa - i\rho\sigma u,\\\\
d &= \sqrt{b^2 + \sigma^2 (i u + u^2)},\\\\
g &= \frac{b - d}{b + d}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
D(\tau,u) &= \frac{b - d}{\sigma^2} \cdot \frac{1 - e^{-d\tau}}{1 - g e^{-d\tau}}, \\\\
C(\tau,u) &= i u r \tau + \frac{\kappa\theta}{\sigma^2} \Big[(b - d)\tau - 2\ln\!\frac{1 - g e^{-d\tau}}{1 - g}\Big].
\end{aligned}
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{\phi(u) = \exp(C + Dv_t + i u \ln S_t)}.
$$

### 4.3 Parameter Roles

| Parameter | Meaning | Effect on \( \phi(u) \) |
|------------|----------|------------------------|
| \( \kappa \) | Mean reversion rate | Controls how quickly volatility returns to equilibrium |
| \( \theta \) | Long-run variance | Sets the baseline variance level |
| \( \sigma \) | Volatility of volatility | Determines how “noisy” the volatility process is |
| \( \rho \) | Correlation | Creates skew (asymmetry) in the implied distribution |
| \( v_t \) | Current variance | Scales current uncertainty |

## 5. FROM MATH TO CODE

### 5.1 Implementation Strategy

```python
import cmath

def heston_characteristic_function(u, tau, x, v, kappa, theta, sigma, rho, r):
    u = complex(u)
    b = kappa - 1j * rho * sigma * u
    d = cmath.sqrt(b**2 + sigma**2 * (1j*u + u**2))
    g = (b - d) / (b + d)

    exp_dt = cmath.exp(-d * tau)
    D = (b - d) / sigma**2 * (1 - exp_dt) / (1 - g * exp_dt)
    log_term = cmath.log((1 - g * exp_dt) / (1 - g))
    C = 1j * u * r * tau + (kappa * theta / sigma**2) * ((b - d) * tau - 2 * log_term)
