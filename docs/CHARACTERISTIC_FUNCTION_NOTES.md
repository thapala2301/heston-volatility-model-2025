# Characteristic Function Learning Notes

## What I Understand So Far:

### 1. In My Own Words:
What is the characteristic function trying to accomplish?

### 2. The Big Picture:
Why can't we use simple Black-Scholes formulas for Heston?

### 3. The Fourier Connection:
How does transforming to "frequency space" help with pricing?

### 4. Questions I Have:
- What exactly is the 'u' parameter?
- Why do we need complex numbers?
- How does this connect to my variance simulation?

## Key Concepts to Research:
- [ ] Characteristic functions in probability
- [ ] Fourier transforms in finance  
- [ ] Complex numbers in quantitative finance
- [ ] Carr-Madan FFT method

## Analogies That Help Me Understand:
[Write your own analogies here]

## How This Fits With My Variance Simulation:
My simulation showed volatility paths. The characteristic function mathematically describes the probabilities of all possible price paths.
